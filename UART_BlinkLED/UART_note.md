# UART Controller (UART)
## Overview
The three UART controllers available on a chip UARTn, where n = 0, 1, and 2.
## UART Features
- Programmable baud rate
- 1024 Ã— 8-bit RAM shared by three UART **transmit-FIFOs** and **receive-FIFOs**
- Supports input baud rate self-check
- Supports 5/6/7/8 bits of data length
- Supports 1/1.5/2/3 STOP bits
- Supports parity bit
- Supports RS485 Protocol
- Supports IrDA Protocol
- Supports DMA to communicate data in high speed
- Supports UART wake-up
- Supports both software and hardware flow control
